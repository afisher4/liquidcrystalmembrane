So far, Iran and its proxies have not responded with the expected attack on Israel due to fear of a massive response targeting their strategic military installations. The following three areas could be targeted by Israel:

1. Hark Island, which contains 90% of the Iranian oil industry.
2. The Iranian parliamentary building.
3. The top five Iranian nuclear facilities.

Iran has no modern air defenses or air force capable of defending against an Israeli attack. Nevertheless, Israel is currently not seeking to further escalate the conflict because they are working on completing their development of new laser weapons and air defenses. The UK is the first nation to successfully deploy laser weapons, so Israel believes it will be able to succeed in developing similar capabilities. Having such technologies would allow Israel to destroy Iranian and Hezbollah precision missiles and likely win if a war were to occur.
